This will be the branch for the 'sconsify it' part of the project

What does it do??
Builds two executables (ma and helloworld), and outputs them to ./outputs/, it also makes two libraries. they are both essentially the same thing, but one is a shared library and one is static. Currently ma implements the static library, because on my system it had issues finding libcma.so after the linking was done.


To Build Project:
run "scons" from the command line from the directory containing the 'SConstruct' file.

To clean project:
run "scons -c" from the command line from the directory containing the 'SConstruct' file.
